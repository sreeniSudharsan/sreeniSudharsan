Welp, I guess much has been revealed to you via the video, though to reiterate myself ðŸ˜„

Known Technical Languages:
Python, Java, JavaScript, C, HTML and CSS

Known Stacks:
MongoDB, Node, React, Express, TensorFlow, git, Docker

I'm currently learning much more about A.I (specifically generators and Natural Language Processing) and it's applications while trying to integrate the same in to any websites that I develop. 

You can ask me about anything as I am always willing to expand my domains! (Though if you're looking for a proper conversation, then I would say I like old rock music, video games and movies!)

You can reach me via the socials that I linked on my account.
